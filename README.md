## Overview
Deployed at http://apsimpoama.ddns.net/lwells/

So there's this trendy farming technique of winter-sowing sorghum.

There is lots of data from APSIM. Our goal is to plot that data in a way that's helpful to farmers.

[Peter deVoil](https://qaafi.uq.edu.au/profile/864/peter-devoil), a great mentor, is supervising me.

## Dependencies
